    <p>Playing soccer in a field is pleasant, no doubt. There's the net, a green lawn, and white lines marking
      boundaries and key areas. However, for some reason as a kid I would play much more often in the streets, where the
      hard surface increases the risk of injury and cars passing by pose an immediate danger. For years, the go-to place
      for intense soccer tournaments for my friends and I has been the parking lot, where traffic hazards were reduced -
      albeit not eliminated - and parked cars added an element of unpredictability to the game.</p>
    <h3>Skinned knees, happy faces </h3>
    <p>During a recent trip back to Italy for Christmas, I spent a month with my parents in the house where I grew up.
      In my childhood, the parking lot would transform into a playground during that time, but now it sits empty.
      Children in my neighborhood, like in the rest of Italy, are becoming increasingly rare. However, during my visit I
      got to revisit our old playing field with my two nephewes, evoking fond memories.</p>

      <article>
        <div class="step" data-step="1">
          <p>My neighborhood is residential area made of terraced houses. At walking distance we had a playground and a
            real soccer field, but we rarely went there. Instead, the parking lot was our playing ground.</p>
          <p>My neighborhood is delimited by a stone wall no taller than six or seven feet. The wall is very old and was
            built during the Napoleonic era. As a kid I misinterpreted this notion, and I would proudly explain to
            friends coming over me that Napoleon itself made that wall.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p>Growing up I had two best friends: Alex and Simone (although Alex was my favorite because he had a pool).
            Our houses were one next to the other and every other day some of us would ring some bell asking to come
            out and play. Right in the middle of our houses there was the parking lot, which made for the most logic
            meeting point.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p>The parking lot was the most awesome thing. It provided a space large enough to run, cars were the
            best hiding spots for hide and seek, and fruit trees from my house and my grandma's house gave us plenty of
            fruits to eat fresh during our pauses. According to the season we would have figs, pomegranades, raspberries
            and persimmons, too (but I did not like persimmons).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>Of the many games we did in that parking lot, soccer is our favorite.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="5">

          <p>It was perfect. Goal posts were
            marked by
            sewer covers although, ideally, you would want a bag or some kind of object on the sewers to avoid harsh
            confrontations on whether that was a goal or post. Parked cars had a role, too. They provided a bouncing
            surface for added imprevidibility (and dirty knees when the ball would get stuck under one of them and the
            responsible had to recover it).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p>A real playing field would have contained our pitch about 40 times! But of course, sometimes there was only
            the three of us playing so that's still a lot of running. </p>
          <p>And our goal was only about six foot shorter than a professional one, that was a long distance to cover for
            one kid! Yet, the size of the goal was indisputable: that's the distance between the sewers! What WAS
            disputable though was the height of the goal, which would vary according to who was the goalkeeper in that
            moment. There was a general consensus that if the ball was too heigh to be reasonably catched, that was a
            miss.</p>
