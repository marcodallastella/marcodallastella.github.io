            <p>Poovandaren Chetty is a South African businessman who went on trial on accuses of fraud, theft and money laundering. However, if you search for his name on Google what you are going to see is almost entirely positive articles. And a strange message.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>In response to a complaint we received under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we have removed 1 result(s) from this page. If you wish, you may read the DMCA complaint that caused the removal(s) at LumenDatabase.org.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>The message informs us that one result was removed from our search due to the US law on copyright rights. In other words, the content was labeled as plagiarized by the original author, who filed a complaint to Google that proceeded removing the content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The details of the complaint reveals that it was very likely fraudulent. It was filed by an anonymous blog registered on tumblr, while the content being removed was published by a reputable South African news site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What happened is an old trick used by shady reputation management companies to launder the reputation of their clients. They copy the content of the story on a blog and then backdated it to the scope of making Google believe that the article had been plagiarized. Incredibly, Google is still falling for this.</p>

            <p>Filing a copyright infringement claim to Google is a common practice for whoever wants to maintain control over their materials on the internet. Since 2011, more than 19 million requests have been filed to Google for copyright infringement. The number has been increasing at a steady pace.</p>
            <p>But making a takedown request to Google does not automatically result in the removal of the content. Google claims paying particular attention to evaluate whether a removal request is legit or not, which involves both automatic and human intervention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the years, the removal requests presented to Google resulted in more than four billion pages removed from the search engine's results. This number peaked in 2016, with almost one billion links removed in a single year, and has since then decreased staying between 200 and 300 million removed links per year. It's unclear the reason why removals decreased suddently despite the increase in requests.

            <p>In what goes of 2023, Google has already received more than two million takedown requests for copyright infringment. Among those that were successful - meaning that resulted in at least one result removed from the platform - more than twenty thousands originated from blogging platforms, mostly from the Google-owned blogpost.

            <p>We isolated successful removal requests for 2023 that were made by a blogging platform. It has been
                reported in the past that shady reputation management companies utilizes these platforms to mantain
                anonimity while trying to get rid of contents on behalf of their clients.
            </p>
            <p>A lot of those false DMCAs have seemingly the same origin.
                In this representation, we see the DMCAs flied by 11 websites.
                The fact that those websites targeted the same pages seems to indicate they were orchestrated by one unique actor.
